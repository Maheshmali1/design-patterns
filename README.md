# Design Patterns in TypeScript

Welcome to the Design Patterns in TypeScript repository! This project is designed to help you learn and practice various design patterns using TypeScript. Each design pattern is implemented with examples to demonstrate its usage and benefits.

## Repository Overview

### Design Patterns Included:

1. **Abstract Factory Pattern**

   - **Description:** Defines an interface for creating an object but leaves the choice of its type to the subclasses, creating the object without specifying its class.
   - **Location:** [abstract-factory-pattern](./src/abstract-factory-pattern/)

2. **Prototype Pattern**

   - **Description:** The Prototype design pattern is good for when creating new objects requires more resources than you want to use or have available.
   - **Location:** [prototype-pattern](./src/prototype-pattern/)

3. **Singleton Pattern**

   - **Description:** The Singleton Pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a way to access it from any point in the application.
   - **Location:** [prototype-pattern](./src/singleton-pattern/)

4. **decorator Pattern**
   - **Description:** The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
   - **Location:** [prototype-pattern](./src/decorator-pattern/)

## How to Use the Repository

npm install
```

4. Start Client file for design pattern using :

```bash
